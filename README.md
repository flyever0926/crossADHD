Just wanted to discuss my struggle with ADHD and depression
<title> How to deal with someone who always think ahead of himself/herself?</title>


<p>When I say someone thinks ahead of himself/herself, for example, I was encouraging my wife to apply for a graduate school in Asia since she has always wanted to try to live in Asia for a couple of years; however, her immediate resonse was to ask why my plan is if we have to move there. She sounded like she already got admitted already, even without looking into any school. </p>

<p> I guess you can call this -"Talk the talk, walk the walk".
